On Saturday, February 8th, the Puyallup Valley JACL welcomes you to our annual Day of Remembrance event, co-sponsored by [the Seattle Chapter of the JACL](http://seattlejacl.org/), [Tsuru for Solidarity](https://tsuruforsolidarity.org/), [Densho](https://densho.org), [the Japanese Cultural & Community Center of Washington](https://www.jcccw.org/), and [the Minidoka Pilgrimage Committee](https://www.minidokapilgrimage.org/).
The Day of Remembrance is a way to acknowledge and honor the over 125,000 people of Japanese descent who were incarcerated during World War II.

To share the charge to ensure that our country not only learns from, but never forgets its past." source="US Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D, 7th District of California)" />
