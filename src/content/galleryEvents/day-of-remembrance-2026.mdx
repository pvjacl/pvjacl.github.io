**Hanako Konishi** is a second-generation Japanese American from the
Seattle area. In 1942, at the age of eight, she, her six siblings, and her
parents were forced from their Seattle home and incarcerated at the
“Puyallup Assembly Center” on the Puyallup Fairgrounds as a result of
Executive Order 9066. She will share her vivid memories of life in this
temporary American concentration camp.

Konishi worked for thirty years in the Highline School District, retiring as
secretary to the deputy superintendent. Since the grand opening of the
Remembrance Gallery in September 2024, she has volunteered as a
docent, sharing her experiences as a survivor.

**Paul Hiroyoshi Tomita** was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In
April 1942, when he was just three years old, Tomita and his family were
imprisoned at the Puyallup Assembly Center. After four months, they were
transferred to Minidoka, where they remained until July 4, 1943 with Paul
constantly asking, what did we do wrong, and when are we going home?
Tomita will share the story of his family’s wartime experience.

After earning a master’s degree in rehabilitation counseling from Oregon
State University, Tomita went on to provide consulting and rehabilitation
services to companies and government agencies throughout the West
Coast. A civil rights activist since the mid-1960s, he continues to advocate
against the detention of immigrants.

community journalist, and public historian. A descendant of Japanese
American World War II incarcerees, she works to preserve this history

**A Place for What We Lose: A Daughter’s Return to Tule Lake**, which

from his unpublished childhood memoir written decades earlier. Nimura
also highlights how intergenerational trauma and silence are transmitted
and how confronting them can foster healing.

the Board of Directors for the Tule Lake Committee. To learn more about

its inception in 2019 and serves on their national council. Shikuma is
a sansei, or third-generation Japanese American. His grandparents,
parents, and older brother were incarcerated during WW2 under Executive
Order 9066. This order set a precedent to allow the military to round up
groups of people “without charge.”

became involved with JACL and Seattle Kokon Taiko. A performer and
composer, he creates original works that explore taiko’s history. He
