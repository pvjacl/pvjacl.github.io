On Saturday, February 21, 2026, the Puyallup Valley JACL welcomes you to our annual Day of Remembrance event, co-sponsored by [the Seattle Chapter of the JACL](http://seattlejacl.org/), [Tsuru for Solidarity](https://tsuruforsolidarity.org/), [Densho](https://densho.org), [the Japanese Cultural & Community Center of Washington](https://www.jcccw.org/), and [the Minidoka Pilgrimage Committee](https://www.minidokapilgrimage.org/).

The Day of Remembrance is a way to acknowledge and honor the over 125,000 people of Japanese descent who were incarcerated during World War II.

<Quote text="The Japanese American community comes together [for the Day of Remembrance] to not only reflect, but to tell our story, teach others, and lift up voices of our community. To share the charge to ensure that our country not only learns from, but never forgets its past." source="US Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D, 7th District of California)" />

The event will be held at the [Washington State Fair](https://thefair.com) Expo Hall.
