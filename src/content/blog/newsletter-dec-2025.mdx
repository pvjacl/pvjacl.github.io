This newsletter will highlight for you some of the highlights of our chapter. The <a href={newsletter2025}>PDF version of this newsletter</a> is also available.

For the past couple of years we have been focused on the
[Remembrance Gallery](/gallery) but the chapter has still been active in the
community. We hope you enjoy this summary.

* 2026 will also be an active year starting with our [Day of Remembrance on
Saturday, February 21](/gallery/gallery-events/day-of-remembrance-2026/), in the Expo Hall on the Washington State
Fairgrounds.
* [Ireichō or Book of Names](/gallery/gallery-events/ireicho-tour/) will come to Seattle on March 27 and to Puyallup on March 28.
* The [Spring Fair](/gallery/gallery-events/spring-fair-2026/) will be April 16 - 20 and April 23 - 26.

We welcome volunteers to assist us to help us welcome our guests. Please contact Eileen for more information.

As you read through this newsletter, we hope you appreciate all that our
chapter does and will consider renewing your membership and making a
donation to the chapter. 

**We are a small but mighty JACL chapter**
