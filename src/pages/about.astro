	The Puyallup Valley Chapter of the <a href="https://jacl.org">Japanese American Citizens League</a> is strongly 
	involved with educational programs and social justice. On August 30, 2024, we opened <a href="/gallery">the Remembrance Gallery</a> to the public.
	Located at the Washington State Fair, the brings awareness to the history of the fairgrounds when they were known as the 
	“Puyallup Assembly Center” (PAC), the largest temporary American concentration camp in Washington State. Through inclusive 
	and comprehensive information, personal stories, and examples of everyday camp life, the Remembrance Gallery encourages an 
	inclusive understanding of the wrongful incarceration of 125,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans in the United States during WWII.
