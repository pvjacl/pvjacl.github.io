reading and research.

government records, the website also features a searchable database for researching individuals and families to find 
out where they were living before the war and which concentration camps they were sent to. Through the website, visitors 
can also find additional guidance and support for carrying out genealogical research.

## Books 
Below is list of books that deal specifically with the experience of Washington residents of Japanese descent. It is by no 
means an exhaustive or definitive list, and we encourage you to explore other recommendations to gain a more balanced 
perspective of this dark chapter in America’s history. While most of the books deal with the Japanese community in Seattle, 
and therefore incarceration at Puyallup and Minidoka, they also address experiences in other communities – including the 
Puyallup and Yakima Valleys – and wartime experiences of other temporary and permanent concentration camps, including Portland, 
Heart Mountain, and Tule Lake.

For additional suggestions, Densho’s website has [**a curated list of 
age-appropriate books about Japanese incarceration**](https://densho.org/catalyst/15-books-about-japanese-american-wwii-incarceration-for-readers-of-all-ages/).

* **WE HEREBY REFUSE: Japanese American Resistance to Wartime Incarceration**, _graphic novel_, 2021, by **Frank Abe and Tamiko Namura** 
The graphic novel profiles three individuals – Jim Akutsu, Hiroshi Kashiwagi, and 
Mitsuye Endo – who each resisted wartime incarceration in different ways, standing up for 
their constitutional rights in the face of wartime hysteria and racial prejudice. 
It deals with themes of draft refusal, legal challenges to wartime incarceration, and 
resistance to the loyalty oath. Jim Akutsu was himself born in Seattle and was a student 
at the University of Washington when the war broke out. As such, his story deals with 
incarceration at both Puyallup and Minidoka.

* **No-No Boy**, _novel_, 1957, by **John Okada**
The novel tells the story of a protagonist who was a so-called ‘No-No Boy’, answering ‘no’ 
to questions 27 and 28 of the War Relocation Authority’s loyalty questionnaire. 
Beginning with the protagonist’s return to Seattle after two years in a concentration camp, 
followed by two years in federal prison for refusing to be drafted into military service, 
the novel deals with themes of civil rights as well as family dynamics in the aftermath 
of the war. The author, John Okada, was himself incarcerated at Puyallup and Minidoka 
before being drafted to serve in the war.

* **Cho’s Story: From the Eyes of a Nisei Son**, _memoir_, by **Choichi Shimizu**
Born and raised in the Puyallup Valley and incarcerated at both Puyallup and Minidoka 
as a young child, Shimizu’s memoir deals with life in the region before the war, 
experiences at both concentration camps, as well as what it was like returning to the 
area after the war.

* **Those Who Helped Us**, _graphic novel_, by **Ken Mochizuki and Kiku Hughes**
The authors tell the story of incarceration from the perspective of a 14-year-old child 
forced to leave her home in Seattle to be incarcerated with her family at Minidoka. 
Although a fictional story based on real events, the book profiles several real-life 
individuals and their acts of charity and solidarity with their Japanese friends and 
neighbors.

* **Baseball Saved Us**, _graphic novel_, by **Ken Mochizuki and Dom Lee**
Inspired by actual events, the graphic novel deals with incarceration at Minidoka from 
an 8-year-old child’s perspective. It gives readers a sense of how children experienced 
the trauma of incarceration, how it affected their sense of identity, and how they found 
ways to cope with imprisonment through activities to boost morale in the concentration camp. 

* **We are Not Strangers**, _graphic novel_, by **Josh Tuininga**
A fictional story inspired by events that involved his family, Tuininga’s graphic novel 
takes place in Seattle during World War II, with the story centering on the relationship 
between two men who were both immigrants – one Japanese, the other a Sephardic Jew. The 
story gives insight into the acts of kindness and bonds between Japanese and other 
immigrant communities, providing an example of the personal sacrifices and risks that 
some people took to look after their friends’ property and businesses in the face of 
social pressure. These exceptional acts often made a significant difference for families, 
making it possible to return to their homes and rebuild their lives after years spent in 
concentration camps.

* **Bouncing Back: Community, Resilience, and Community**, _memoir_, by **Isao Fujimoto**
The book provides insight into the experiences of families living in Central Washington, 
specifically the Yakima Valley, where Fujimoto and his family farmed land in Wapato, on the 
Yakama Indian Reservation. The book deals with his experiences of being incarcerated with 
his family as an 8-year-old, at both Heart Mountain and Tule Lake, as well as reflections 
on life after the war and how the family started anew.

* **Displacement**, _graphic novel_, by **Kiku Hughes**
The main character in the graphic novel, Kiku, is unexpectedly pulled back in time from 
the current day to the 1940s. She finds herself living alongside her grandmother, witnessing 
the experiences of her and others who were denied their civil liberties and human rights when 
forced into concentration camps during World War II. The book informs readers about this 
chapter of American history in a unique way, highlighting the intergeneration impacts of 
wartime incarceration.
