      President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-9066">Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942</a>. 
      This order allowed the military to create exclusion zones that led to the forced removal of all Japanese and Japanese Americans 
      from the West Coast and other designated areas.  
    </p>    
    <p>
      Between April and September 1942, the Washington
      State Fairgrounds (at the time called the Puyallup
      Fairgrounds) served as one of seventeen makeshift
      temporary concentration camps set up by the United States Army
      as a result of Executive Order 9066.
      At the “Puyallup Assembly Center” (PAC), over 7,500
      Japanese and Japanese Americans from Alaska, Seattle,
      and rural towns of Pierce County were imprisoned
      before being moved inland to one of ten permanent
      concentration camps.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In total, over 125,000 people of Japanese ancestry
      living along the West Coast were imprisoned. More
      than two-thirds were American-born citizens. The rest
      were Issei, first generation legal immigrants, unable by law
      to become citizens. <a href="/history/additional-resources/">Learn more about the lives of Japanese immigrants and their families</a>.

      The Remembrance Gallery brings awareness to the history 
      of the “Puyallup Assembly Center” (PAC), as the largest 
      temporary American concentration camp in Washington State.   
    </p>
    <p>
      The Puyallup Assembly Center was nicknamed “Camp Harmony” 
      by an editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, a local newspaper. 
      The photographer mentioned in his report that the people from the 
      Japanese community were quiet and harmonious. Neither the government 
      nor military were opposed to the concentration camp being known as 
      a “camp”. Thus, the general public was allowed to think the prisoners 
      were camping and a nickname that obscures the reality of PAC conditions persists to this day.
