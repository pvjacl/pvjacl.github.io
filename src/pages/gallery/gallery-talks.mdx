The Puyallup Valley JACL organizes presentations and talks for a variety of audiences about the wartime incarceration 
of Americans of Japanese descent. To learn more, and to schedule a time for your school, group, or organization, 
contact us at [PuyallupValleyJACL@gmail.com](mailto:PuyallupValleyJACL@gmail.com).

### Classroom Talks
Topics for classroom visits may vary. **Introductory presentations** can provide a broad overview of wartime incarceration 
and the experiences of Japanese and Japanese Americans in the United States before, during, and after the war. 
Presentations may also be tailored to specific themes. 

**Culminating talks and presentations** may also be arranged, including those where a survivor of an American concentration 
camp is brought to your class to speak on their personal experience, as availability allows. 

**NOTE:** If requesting a culminating presentation with a survivor, it is expected that your class has already learned about 
the history of wartime incarceration in the United States.
