  The Puyallup Valley JACL offers group tours of the Remembrance Gallery. A visit to the Gallery includes a brief welcome and 
  overview of the three Gallery sections. From there, your group will have time to explore our interactive and immersive 
  content about wartime incarceration at the Fairgrounds, the events and policies that preceded this, and the impacts this 
  had on families and communities across generations. 
</p>
<p class="no-bottom-margin">
  The three distinct areas of exploration in the Gallery include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monument &ndash; Displays over 7,500 names of those imprisoned at the Fairgrounds</li>
  <li>Throughline &ndash;  Utilizes interactive touchscreens to deliver historical content, oral histories about the incarceration 
    experience, interactive maps, and key documents and biographies</li>
  <li>Confinement &ndash;  Displays a replica of one of the 8 foot x 10 foot horse stalls where up to six people lived</li>
</ul>
<p>
  More details are available on our <a href="/gallery">Gallery Overview page</a> or in our <a href="/galleryAssets/RG-Brochure_FINAL.pdf">Gallery brochure</a>.

  Japanese American history and the incarceration of people of Japanese descent during World War II.

  incarceration in the United States. This resource ensures:

  <li>Wartime experience is authentically, and respectfully represented and portrayed</li>
  <li>Accurate historical context is provided to students</li>
</ul>
