  <p>
    The Puyallup Valley Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL)
    presents the "Puyallup Assembly Center" Remembrance Gallery. The Gallery 
    encourages an inclusive understanding of the wrongful incarceration of
    125,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans in the United States during WWII 
    (<a href="/history/additional-resources/">Learn more about mass incarceration during World War II</a>).
    The Washington State Fair has provided a space to build a
    permanent historic exhibit inside the grandstand, which is part of the
    original confinement site (<a href="/history/assembly-history">Learn more about the history of the Puyallup Assembly Center</a>). 
  </p>

  <h3>Overview of Gallery Sections</h3>
  <p>
    The Remembrance Gallery has three distinct sections providing 
    inclusive and comprehensive information,
    personal stories, and examples of everyday camp life.
    Each section is designed to provide a variety of media
    to better understand this wartime experience.

      <h4>Monument</h4>
      <p>
        The heart of the gallery is a memorial wall that lists
        the names of over 7,500 people imprisoned on these
        fairgrounds. Their names are in alphabetical order according to family last names
        along with their government-assigned family number.
      </p>
      <h4>Confinement</h4>
      <p>Visitors can step inside a full-size 8 feet by 10 feet historic
        replica of the horse stalls, used as makeshift housing
        for many PAC incarcerees. It is an immersive, multisensory experience of the living conditions where up
        to four men, women, and children lived in a single stall.
        within the dark, dirty stables under the grandstands.</p>
      <h4>Throughline</h4>
      <p>Interactive touchscreen displays illuminate and
        humanize the stories of survivors. Through interviews
        and comprehensive content, visitors can learn about
        a range of topics, including: discrimination and
        racist laws, Nisei veterans, civil disobedience, acts of
        kindness, and the influence of camp life on artists and
        authors. Current events are also presented, highlighting
        how communities are still denied safety, civil liberties,
        and human rights today due to prejudice and bigotry.
        A Map Station traces the paths of Washington Nikkei
        as they were forcibly removed from their homes to
        concentration camps, using movement and distance to
        emphasize the impact on individuals and communities.
