		The Puyallup Valley JACL Remembrance Gallery honors those who were imprisoned at the Washington State Fairgrounds, 
		raising awareness about this chapter in history and its continued relevance today. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Remembrance Gallery is a volunteer based non-profit organization. We are dedicated to helping educate the public about <a href="/history/assembly-history/">Japanese American 
		history</a> and how civil and human rights need to be protected for all. We continue to welcome new volunteers to join us in support of this work.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to opportunities during the Spring Fair and <a href="https://thefair.com/">Washington State Fair</a>, we host special events and scheduled 
		tours and school visits throughout the year. Regular opportunities are listed below, but we also welcome those with other interests and skills to reach out. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Interested in volunteering?</strong> Please reach out to Sharon Sobie-Seymour, (Gallery Manager), at 
		<a href="mailto:PVJACL_gallerytours@gmail.com">PVJACL_gallerytours@gmail.com</a>.

	<h3 class="text-center">Ways to Volunteer</h3>
	<h5>Gallery Assistants</h5>
	<p>
		Gallery assistants can provide support in a variety of ways, depending on abilities and interest. This can include welcoming visitors, assisting in wayfinding, 
		and answering general questions. Outside of the Gallery, assistants can also support us at community and public outreach events throughout the region.
	</p>
	<h5>Gallery Docents</h5>
	<p>
		Docents play an important role in visitor engagement at the Remembrance Gallery, helping people to understand the goal and relevance of 
		the Gallery and to orient themselves within the space. You donâ€™t need to be an expert in the history of wartime incarceration but will be 
		provided with training, talking points, and other resources to familiarize yourself with the general topics and themes so that you can direct 
		visitors to relevant content and information.
